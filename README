The leading developers of blenderRepRap-addon are currently borisov-r and zubenelacribi, though anyone is more than wellcome to contribute to this project.

This is our attempt of integration RepRap into Blender 2.6. Firmware used for RerRap is Sprinter and Tonokip for communication.

This work is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or (at the user's discretion) any later version.

==============================================

Main goals of the project:
1. Simple control and communcation with RepRap printer from Blender's interface.
2. Button for generation of GCode of selected object(s). For the generation of the code we intend to use Slic3r (http://slic3r.org/).
3. Import GCode in blender for visualization of the path.
4. Add possibility to change the path, speed and save the changes.
5. Print the generated GCode directly from Blender.

==============================================

Let's see where it will end :)
